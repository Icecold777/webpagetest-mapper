## Why would I want that?

Perhaps you'd like
to generate a report
containing sprauncy visualizations
of your website's performance.
Or maybe you want
to analyse all of the raw data behind
WebPageTest's median-based summaries
using a spreadsheet.

This tool can help you
do both of those things.
It can also be extended
to map WebPageTest result data
into any conceivable format.

## How do I install it?

If you're using npm:

```
npm install webpagetest-mapper --save
```

Or if you just want the git repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:nature/webpagetest-mapper.git
```

### As a library

TODO

```javascript
TODO: examples
```

## Is there a change log?

[Yes][history].

## How do I set up the build environment?

The build environment relies on
node.js,
[JSHint],
[Mocha],
[Chai],
[Mockery] and
[Spooks].
Assuming that you already have node and NPM set up,
you just need to run `npm install` to
install all of the dependencies as listed in `package.json`.

You can lint the code
with the command `npm run lint`.

You can run the unit tests
with the command `npm test`.
